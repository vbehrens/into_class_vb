#create a dictionary for all the eligible words to be used as outputs
#prompt user for input - show all the input options available
	#show an error message if a user inputs a value that is not valid
#store the input and find which values in the dictionary have the input in the defintion
#write some logic to return the values
#write some logic to also return some alternative defintions that may also be suitable even though the input isn't in the definiton.
#display the definitions to the user
